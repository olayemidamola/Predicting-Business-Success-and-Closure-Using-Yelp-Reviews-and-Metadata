## Overview

Analyze historical Yelp data to identify factors distinguishing successful businesses from those that close. Build predictive models to assess business risk and provide actionable insights via a Tableau dashboard.


## Objectives

* Clean and preprocess Yelp datasets.
* Perform EDA to uncover business and customer patterns.
* Build models:

  * K-Means clustering (customer/business segmentation)
  * Recommendation system
  * Sentiment analysis
* Visualize insights via Tableau dashboard.
* Provide actionable business recommendations.


## Scope

**In-Scope:** Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model development, dashboard creation, reporting.
**Out-of-Scope:** Real-time deployment, paid data enrichment, third-party proprietary data.

## Risks

* Incomplete/corrupt data → Validate JSON & handle missing values
* Low model accuracy → Hyperparameter tuning & multiple algorithms
* Time constraints → Agile sprints & Jira tracking
* Limited computing resources → Google Colab Pro, optimize code
* GitHub sync issues → Regular commits & backups


## Communication

* Weekly progress reports
* Jira updates
* Bi-weekly supervisor meetings
* Final presentation


## Success Criteria

* Cleaned and validated Yelp datasets
* Models achieve meaningful segmentation, recommendations, and sentiment classification
* Tableau dashboard communicates actionable insights clearly
* Peer-reviewed deliverables
* Positive feedback from faculty/stakeholders


## Post-Project Evaluation

* Retrospective: lessons learned
* Document reproducible workflow
* Share dashboard/results online
* Reflect on skills developed (EDA, ML, visualization)
